# SaveTheEarth

Im THOR-THE GOD OF THUNDER.Im here to protect our universe.Being the sonof odin,my sole task is to protect both asgard and earth.I was born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard. I grew into a mighty warrior and protector of my home and people. I was thought to be rash and even reckless by my father, I nevertheless looked forward to the day of my ascension to the throne. But, my adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never arrived.

He manipulated me into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of the Asgardians and Loki’s people, and Odin—hoping to teach his son humility—divested me of my magic hammer Mjolnir and banished me to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.
Alone and unable to return to Asgard, I met scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig in the midst of their investigation into strange activity near a small New Mexico town. 

While my brother struggled with the limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to allow the Frost Giant king—his real father—into Asgard to slay my father in his sleep. Back on Earth, I sacrificed himself to save the town from destruction and in doing so, impressed Odin enough to restore myself to full Asgardian power.


With Mjolnir once again in my grasp and the admiration and possible love of Jane Foster, I returned to my home, routed the Frost Giants, and defeated Loki in battle. Chagrined at my loss and stinging from Odin’s condemnation, Loki chose to fall away from Asgard into a strange warp in space while me and my father looked on. Though happy to be back in Asgard, my thoughts were filled with adventure on Midgard with Jane Foster


I can call down lightning and thunder at will and utilize them like a blacksmith uses his tools to work iron and steel—bending and shaping them into weapons
